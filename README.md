Challenges faced during setup.
The main challenge I faced was downloading MySQL where I decided to delete it after I installed it wrongly but forgot to delete the paths. Since I had not deleted the paths when i went to install it again I found an error so I could not continue and had to delete the one I downloaded second. Before downloading a third and last time I decided to delete the paths by going to the program file and program data and delete the MySQL paths. I also had to delete the redistributables in order to avoid errors and download them again while installing MySQL a third time.
